        This is the application assembly. The schema declaration above gives code-completion in supported IDEs
        (works in AppCode, but the Xcode XML editor doesn't resolve schemas, it seems).
        Dependencies can be resolved by reference (ie a name), by matching the required type or protocol or by value.
        Dependencies can be declared in any order - Spring Objective-C will work out how to resolve them.

                Property arguments can also be injected by value. The container will look up the required
                class or primitive type. It's easy to register your own additional converters.

        <description>
            Knight has a dependency on any class conforming to the Quest protocol. In this case it's a
            [CampaignQuest class].

            Note the 'after-property-injection' attribute. This is a custom method that can be called after all
            properties have been injected.

        <property name="imageUrl" value="http://www.appsquick.ly/theQuest.jpg">
            <description>
                This is a property of type NSURL. The container will convert the supplied string value
                and inject it for us.

                Besides the primitive types (int, BOOL, etc), a handful of useful object conversion types
                are included. You can also easily register your own additional converters.

    <component class="NSURL" key="serviceUrl">
        <description>
            This is an example of a component instantiated from a class method. (In fact, you could inject
            an NSURL instance directly by value, but anyway. . . ).

            Note the "is-class-method" attribute: Spring Objective-C will normally guess this, so if the method
            follows objective-c naming conventions, this wouldn't be needed. That is to say, if the method name
            starts with "init" it will be treated as an instance method, otherwise it will be resolved as a
            class method. . . supplying this attribute will override Spring Objective-C's guess.

        <initializer selector="URLWithString:" is-class-method="yes">
            <description>
                Unlike property injection, initializer arguments require type to be set explicitly, unless the
                type is a primitive - BOOL, int, etc. . . (This is because the Objective-C runtime doesn't
                include detailed type information for selectors - only whether the type is an object or
                primitive type. (The container will remind you to set this attribute if you forget).
